# Tikondane

In winter 2022 I spent 3 months volunteering at the [Tikondane Community
Centre](https://tikondane.org) in Katete, Zambia.

While there, I set the center up for crowdfunding on
[DonorSee](https://donorsee.com/tikondane) and helped 8 families secure funding
for life changing home improvement projects.

Before leaving, I trained a group of Tiko workers to manage the crowdfunding
project on their own.  This way they would no longer be reliant on volunteers
and could lead all fundraising with minimal guidance.

This repository contains all the materials I used during this training.  It is
available on the web at
[https://purple4reina.github.io/tiko/](https://purple4reina.github.io/tiko/) so
the Tiko workers can easily find any answers they need.
