I'm reaching out to ask for your help in making a real difference in the lives
of people at the Tikondane Community Centre in Zambia, where I volunteer. I'll
be heading back there on Friday, July 19, 2024, for a month and a half to
continue my work, and I'm hoping to bring some much-needed technology with me.

The community center recently got StarLink internet service, providing speeds
of 200Mbps, and now we're looking to get smartphones into the hands of everyone
who works there. Having access to these devices could be life-changing,
enabling better communication, access to information, and even the possibility
of online work through platforms like Mechanical Turk. For people currently
making around $20 a month, this opportunity could substantially increase their
income and improve their lives.

If you have any old, unlocked smartphones that you're no longer using, please
consider donating them to this cause. It doesn't matter how old they are, as
long as they're functional and unlocked. Your donation could help bridge the
digital divide and provide access to opportunities that were previously out of
reach.

To donate a phone, please reach out to me directly via email at
<a href="mailto:purple4reina@gmail.com">purple4reina@gmail.com</a>. I'll be
happy to arrange a time to collect the phone from you or provide an address
where you can mail it.  Please ensure that I receive the phone before Friday,
July 19, 2024, so I can bring it with me to Zambia.

If you don't have a phone to donate but still want to support this cause, you
can help by spreading the word to your friends, family, and colleagues who
might have old smartphones they're willing to give.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and for considering this request.
Your generosity could truly change lives.
